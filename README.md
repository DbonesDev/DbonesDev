### 💾 1. The Nostalgia (1995-2000)

I code because I miss the **Golden Age of Computing**. 

I miss the time when software came in boxes, manuals were thick, and the web was a library, not a feed. I miss the raw honesty of `C`, the silence of offline mode, and the thrill of understanding how the machine actually works.

My goal is to capture that spirit of discovery and ownership using modern tools.

> *"It's not about the hardware; it's about the mindset."*

### 💀 2. The Philosophy: Memento Mori

**I am an eternal student.** In a field where frameworks die every year, I choose to study what remains.

* **The Engineer's Code:** Professionally, I build Data Pipelines and train ML Models. However, I refuse to write fragile scripts. I apply rigorous **Software Engineering** principles to Data Science.
* **Bare Metal:** I prefer Rust because it strips away the layers of abstraction and lets me touch the iron.
* **Memento Mori:** Code rots. Systems fail. I strive to build software with the humility of knowing that simplicity is the only thing that survives time.

### 🛠️ 3. The Workbench

I build robust systems using the **H.A.T. Stack** (Hypermedia, Alpine, Tailwind) powered by Rust. It's the closest I can get to the simplicity of 1999 with the power of 2025.

| Domain | Tools of Choice |
| :--- | :--- |
| **The Iron (Backend)** | `Rust` `Axum` `Tokio` |
| **The View (Frontend)** | `HTMX` `Askama` (Server-Side Rendering FTW) |
| **The Data (Engineering)** | `PostgreSQL` `SQLx` `Polars` `Apache Arrow` |
| **The Brain (AI/ML)** | `Candle` `Burn` `LLM Core` `PyTorch` |
| **The Soul** | `Vim` `Linux` `Classical Music` |

### 🔭 Current Quest

I am currently pouring my efforts into the **Arca Platform** and deepening my understanding of generative AI mechanics.

- 🧠 **Deconstructing AI:** Reading *"Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)"* and re-implementing the core architecture (Self-Attention, GPT) entirely in **Rust**. No magic, just tensors.
- 🏗️ **Building:** An "Essay-to-Learn" engine for Arca.
- 🌱 **Studying:** Ancient Rhetoric & Rust Macros.
